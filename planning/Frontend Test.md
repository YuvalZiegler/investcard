*Frontend Test*
*===========*

Imagine you're designing an invest card for a crowdsourcing site not unlike
Alphaworks. The Invest Card is where users/investors get in on the deal. It
needs to succinctly display the status of the deal (is it open, is it
funded, etc.) as well as facilitate investors making a reservation. Some
examples of these cards are seen on Alphaworks, as well as Kickstarter.

Design and implement an Invest Card showing three states:
1. Not yet open, with information about when the deal will open (date and time)
2. Open, ready to accept investments. This state should have a input box
for the amount, an Invest button, a progress bar for how full the deal is
3. Funded. Display status about total money raised, possibly with a
progress bar.

Requirements:
- Use whatever frontend technology you're most comfortable with.
- You should implement this exclusively on the frontend, so no backend
functionality required. You can mock up the buttons to not do anything or
display a Javascript alert.
- Put all the different states of the card on one easy to open file (html).
- You can grab assets from alphaworks.net/c/gimlet-media or make up your own.
- Your submission should include instructions, your motivation for why you
chose the technology you did as well as other explanations that gives an
understanding of your thought process.

This task is not supposed to take a long amount of time to finish. What
we're looking for is matched by the job requirements. The main goal is to
see how you approach a task like this, and how you design and implement.
