        <h1 class="mui-font-style-title">The process</h1>
        <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          As a first step I created a  <a href="./prototype.html" target="_blank">quick prototype</a> for each of the states using Balsamiq and took some notes on the UX and the UI.

        </p>
        <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          I picked the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/" target="_blank">Flux application architecture</a> along with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a> for the purpose of this demo. Flux and React are used on large scale application at facebook. Flux complements React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow, it is more of a pattern rather than a formal framework, and I think it's unidirectional nature makes it easier to reason about compared to traditional data binding. React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance. It can also render on the server which allows it to be Search engine optimized.

        <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          I used <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a> with <a href="http://browserify.org/" target="_blank">Browserify</a> to preprocess and bundle the assets.
        </p>
        <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          you can <a href="https://github.com/YuvalZiegler/investcard.git">download the source code here</a>.

        <h1 class="mui-font-style-title">The next steps</h1>
        <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          I would make the product name and logo clickable and add a “learn more” link that will expand the card to display more details about the company, a list of user who had already invested and a comment thread discussing the investment. I think this will help user feel more confident about investing in the product.
        </p>
        <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          I would implement the “remind me” functionality to allow users to be either notified via email or add an event to their calendars
        </p>
        <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          I would also have the card connect via <a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank">socket.io</a> or use a service like <a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> so investments update in real-time.
