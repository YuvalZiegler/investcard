          I picked the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/" target="_blank">Flux application architecture</a> along with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a> for the purpose of this demo. Flux and React are used on large scale application at facebook. Flux complements React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow, It's more of a pattern rather than a formal framework it is easier to reason about than traditional data binding. React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance. It can also render on the server which allows it to be Search engine optimized.

          I used <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a> with <a href="http://browserify.org/" target="_blank">Browserify</a> to preprocess and bundle the assets.
