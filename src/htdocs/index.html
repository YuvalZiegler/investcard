          <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">Imagine you’re designing an invest card for a crowdsourcing site. 
          The Invest Card is where users/investors get in on the deal. It
          needs to succinctly display the status of the deal (is it open, is it
          funded, etc.) as well as facilitate investors making a reservation.
          </p>
          <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">Design and implement an Invest Card showing three states:</p>
          <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          1. Not yet open, with information about when the deal will open (date and time)
          <br/>
          2. Open, ready to accept investments. This state should have a input box for the amount, an Invest button, a progress bar for how full the deal is.
          <br/>
          3. Funded. Display status about total money raised, possibly with a progress bar.

          <h1 class="mui-font-style-title">The Requirements</h1>
          <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
            - Use whatever frontend technology you’re most comfortable with.
            <br/>
            - You should implement this exclusively on the frontend, so no backend functionality required. You can mock up the buttons to not do anything or display a Javascript alert.
            <br/> 
            - Put all the different states of the card on one easy to open file (html).
            <br/>
            - Your submission should include instructions, your motivation for why you chose the technology you did as well as other explanations that gives an understanding of your thought process.

        <h1 class="mui-font-style-title">The process</h1>
        <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          As a first step I created a  <a href="./images/prototype.gif" target="_blank">quick prototype</a> for each of the states using Balsamiq and took some notes on the UX and the UI.

        </p>
        <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          I picked the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/" target="_blank">Flux application architecture</a> along with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a> for the purpose of this demo. Flux and React are used on large scale application at facebook. Flux complements React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow, It's more of a pattern rather than a formal framework it is easier to reason about than traditional data binding. React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance. It can also render on the server which allows it to be Search engine optimized.
        </p>
        <p class="mui-font-style-body-2">
          I used <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a> with <a href="http://browserify.org/" target="_blank">Browserify</a> to preprocess and bundle the assets.
